## Summary
From powering nuclear aircraft carriers to exploring the complexities of cloud computing, my career has been a journey of both engineering discipline and technical creativity. I am Drew, and I enjoy making the digital world more efficient and reliable, one line of code at a time.

I started in the United States Navy as a Nuclear Engineer for nearly a decade before becoming a contractor, where I developed complex procedures for the Navy. In 2016, I founded Host Octopus Limited Liability Company, diving into web development, hosting, and digital marketing. Later, I joined Flywheel as a Senior Happiness Engineer, resolving more than eleven thousand tickets with record-high satisfaction.

My career advanced at Ally Bank, where I managed Content Delivery Network operations, handled continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and optimized configurations for a better developer experience. Further along, I embraced Development Operations (DevOps) responsibilities at Primex, focusing on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, Python updates, and data management. In parallel, I freelanced in various DevOps capacities to broaden my skill set.

I also enjoy teaching and have created many free learning materials at CodingWithDrew.com. Let us connect and see how we can collaborate on extraordinary projects.

**1. David Brandwein | Content Delivery Network Engineer at Marriott International**  
“Drew’s passion for technology is obvious every day. He is Development Operations (DevOps) to the core, with a rare and innate ability to solve complex problems from an arsenal of skills and tools he has acquired over the years. Drew seems to be omnilingual, able to create or contribute to code in any language. He is so easy to work with, both because he is such a capable engineer, but also because he loves to teach. I am lucky to work with him. He is an incredible asset and has earned my highest recommendation for any Development Operations or Site Reliability Engineering related work.”

**2. Kim Bell | Software Engineer at Ally Bank**  
“Drew was the Development Operations and Site Reliability Engineer working with my team when I was a developer. No matter what was going on, he always had a positive attitude and took the time to explain and answer any questions we had. He was diligent and dedicated. For instance, we had a regularly occurring problem that until Drew, no one had an answer for. He not only got to the root of the problem, but while he was with us, he resolved the problem when it occurred and did his best to push for a procedural change that would permanently remedy the situation. It would be a pleasure to work with Drew again and any team and organization would benefit from his talent and hard work.”

**3. John White | Senior Software Engineer at Live Oak Bank**  
“I have had the pleasure of working with Drew this year and have come to admire his dedication and expertise. His passion for his work is evident in every project he takes on, whether he is working in a familiar domain or exploring new technologies. He is approachable—ask him about what he is working on, and you will get a warm reception and will feel like collaborating on the task by the end of the conversation. Any team or project would be fortunate to have his caliber of professionalism and commitment.”

**5. Mikah Pinegar | Front End React Developer at North Carolina State University**  
“I work with a research team out of North Carolina State University and we hired Drew as a contractor to create a Development Operations ecosystem for us. He created a very robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery system using Microsoft Azure Pipelines, Kubernetes, and Terraform. He is extremely proficient at working on his own and documenting things as he goes. This was ideal for our small team. Some areas where Drew shines especially are automation, documentation, and communication. He researched and then presented many different solutions to our team in a way that was easily understandable and then implemented what we decided on. Overall, Drew is a great employee and anyone would be lucky to work with him!”

**6. John Schuncke | Team Lead at Flywheel**  
“Drew’s passion and enthusiasm is inexhaustible. He is always striving to learn new things and to share his knowledge with others. He is a good person, and I miss working with him.”

“I had the pleasure of working with Drew at Flywheel for over a year on our support team. As a new person in this sort of technology industry, Drew was always the person I called on to learn from. Drew is extremely technical but has a great way of being a team player and cascading all of his knowledge to anyone willing or needing to learn. Pairing all of that with superior workflows and optimization, any employer would benefit from Drew’s skill set and efficiency. We miss him on the team dearly and needed three new hires to fill his void!”

**12. Nitant Soni | Site Reliability Engineer – WordPress Hosting for Creatives**  
“Drew is a fantastic person to work with and has excellent people skills. He was really good at his role as Senior Happiness Engineer, and in the time he was there, he made something of a reputation for working on the toughest problems and tickets. I had the chance to work with him and provide assistance on a few complex issues. He was very quick to learn and able to quickly understand the solution and not only relay it to the customer in an easy-to-understand language, but also created documentation to help other team members.”

**13. Breanna Carodine | Happiness Engineer at Flywheel**  
“Drew was a coworker of mine at Flywheel, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I would not be as successful as I am in my job without him. He always jumped in to help when I had an issue and was patient but also incredibly thorough. He always had an answer and shortcuts to get to the solution as quickly as possible. Drew was consistently leveling up. He was never comfortable with being just okay, and he has never believed that he ‘knows enough.’ Drew liked collecting all the information possible and through this it helped him be an incredibly knowledgeable resource and also inspired the rest of us to level up as well. He also uses the knowledge he gains to educate others. Even now, he creates resources for people to use for further understanding in different areas of technology. We no longer work together, but I know that if I needed help on something he would be there to assist.”

**14. Nguyen “Win” Tong | Happiness Engineer at Flywheel**  
“I had the pleasure to be on the same support team as Drew. He was no doubt a top performer within a team of sixteen. Drew was always there to offer his expertise and guidance whenever possible while juggling multiple tickets at the same time. Although he started on the team late, he was the first to finish ten thousand support chats. Drew is one of those individuals that I would love to have on my team.”

**15. Joshua Richards | Loss Control Inspector at Hartford Steam Boiler**  
“Drew and I met in the Navy, and he struck me immediately as a very hard-working individual who strives to increase his level of knowledge on a continuous basis. Over our time together in the Navy, we worked closely, and I found Drew to be a great leader and someone who came up with creative ways to improve processes, specifically within the logistical processes of our department. We have kept in contact since leaving the Navy, and our conversations have only reinforced that first impression I had of Drew. His passion for learning and deepening his skill set and understanding of relevant matters has not slowed at all, and I believe Drew would bring great value to any company that employed him.”

**16. Josh Collinsworth | Front End Developer, Designer, Code Instructor**  
“Working together at Flywheel and WordPress Engine, I got to know Drew as someone who is relentlessly passionate about user experience, quality code, and building things the right way. Drew cares deeply about the work he does and how it impacts people. He is impressively curious, never stops learning, and is the kind of coworker who will be the first to step up and support his teammates in the face of any challenge.”

**17. Jhuan (Jay) Pressley | Senior Cyber Attack Surface Analyst**  
“Drew is a team player if I ever saw one. His Development Operations and leadership skills are out of this world. He has a massive understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle and networking protocols. If you are in a triage for any issue within the Open Systems Interconnection model, Drew is a no-brainer as a resource you want on the front lines.”
